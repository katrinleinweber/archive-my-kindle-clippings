# Archive my Kindle clippings

This script moves and cleans-up my Kindle clippings into an archive folder,
and **afterwards purges** the `My Clippings.txt` file on the device.
See the [`archive_clippings.sh` file](archive_clippings.sh) for more details.

It is intended to be used for reading & annotating 1 book at a time,
**not for archiving accumulated clippings**. Find tools for that via:
[GitHub.com/topics/kindle-clippings](https://github.com/topics/kindle-clippings).
